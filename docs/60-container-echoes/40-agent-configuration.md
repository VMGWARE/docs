# Configuring the Container Echoes Agent

## Agent Role and Functionality

The Container Echoes Agent plays a crucial role in the log management system. It is responsible for capturing logs from Docker containers and forwarding them to the Container Echoes Server. Proper configuration of the agent is vital to ensure efficient log collection and transmission.

## Configuration Options

### Setting Up the Agent

1. **Installation**: The agent is deployed as a Docker container on each host. Use the provided Docker image to install the agent.
2. **Configuration File**: The agent's behavior is controlled through a configuration file, typically named `agent-config.json`. This file should be placed in a directory accessible to the agent container.

### Key Configuration Parameters

- `logPath`: Specifies the path where the agent should collect logs from the Docker containers.
- `serverAddress`: The URL or IP address of the Container Echoes Server for log forwarding.
- `containerFilter`: (Optional) Defines filters to select specific containers for log collection based on names, labels, or other criteria.

### Environment-Specific Settings

Depending on your environment, you may need to adjust additional settings such as network configurations, proxy settings, or Docker socket paths.

## Best Practices

- **Resource Allocation**: Ensure that the agent has sufficient resources (CPU and memory) to handle the volume of log data.
- **Security**: If the agent communicates over the network, ensure that the traffic is encrypted and authenticated.
- **Log Rotation**: Configure log rotation policies to prevent disk space issues on the host running the agent.

## Testing and Verification

After configuration, test the agent to ensure it is correctly collecting and forwarding logs. You can do this by:

1. Running a test container that generates logs.
2. Verifying that these logs appear in the Container Echoes Server interface.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the agent's logs for any error messages. Common issues include network connectivity problems, configuration errors, or resource constraints.

## Next Steps

With the agent configured, you can now focus on managing the Container Echoes Server and exploring its features, as detailed in [Managing the Container Echoes Server](50-server-management.md).
