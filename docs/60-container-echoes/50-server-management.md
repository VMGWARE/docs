# Managing the Container Echoes Server

## Server Functionality

The Container Echoes Server is the central component of the log management system. It is responsible for storing, processing, and displaying logs collected from Docker containers by the Agent. Effective management of the server ensures optimal performance and reliability of the log management system.

## Starting the Server

1. **Initialization**: Ensure all prerequisites, like the database and environment variables, are set.
2. **Launching**: Start the server using `npm start` or your preferred process manager (like PM2 or Docker).

## Maintenance and Monitoring

Regular maintenance is crucial for the smooth operation of the server.

### Routine Checks

- **Database Health**: Regularly check the database for integrity and performance issues.
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor the server's CPU, memory, and disk usage. Adjust resources as necessary.
- **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation for the server logs to avoid disk space issues.

### Updating the Server

- **Updates**: Regularly update the server software to the latest version to ensure security and performance.
- **Backup**: Always backup your configurations and database before applying updates.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Server Not Responding

- Check network connectivity.
- Verify if the server process is running.
- Look into server logs for any error messages.

### Database Connectivity Issues

- Ensure the database is running and accessible.
- Verify the database connection parameters in the server's configuration.

### Performance Issues

- Check for high resource usage and scale resources as necessary.
- Optimize database queries if database performance is a bottleneck.

## Security Considerations

- **SSL/TLS**: Enable SSL/TLS for encrypted communication between the server and agents.
- **Firewalls**: Configure firewalls to allow only necessary traffic to and from the server.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the server and its dependencies updated to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

- Regularly backup the server's database and configuration files.
- Have a disaster recovery plan in place, including procedures for restoring from backups.
